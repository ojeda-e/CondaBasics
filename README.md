# Reviewing the Basics

In this repo we review:

1. [Jupyter notebooks](01_Jupyter.ipynb), to edit and run code from your browser. 
1. [Conda](02_Conda.ipynb), a package/environment manager for Data Science (and the one used for the MLPB course). 
1. [Git](03_Git.ipynb), a Version Control protocol that keeps track of every modification in your work.
1. [Python](04_Python.ipynb), a popular programming lenguage broadly used and very convenient to perform Data Science, and Machine Learning. Here, we will focus on the Pandas module for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

We also provide two hands-on notebooks focused on Pandas. The first one uses [metabolomics data](notebooks/06_HandsOn_Metabolomics.ipynb), and the second one uses a [healthcare dataset](notebooks/07_HandsOn_HealthData.ipynb) to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.


This repository is part of the Machine Learning with Python for Biologists course MLPB offered in the 2020 spring-summer term at The University of Calgary. For more information please visit the [course-website](https://soerendip.github.io/MLPB/).
