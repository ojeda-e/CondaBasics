# This is an example of md file

This is a list:
- This is
- an extra
- MLPB session

We can use **bold** font.

We can include pictures (of kitties, because kitties are cute):

<img src='../img/kitty.png' width=300>

We can include a piece of code:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    x = [1, 2, 3]
    y = x*2+ x
    print(y)
    
and all the things we have seen on md files from previous sessions so far.
